# Welcome to the arrogantly names library of, Good Email Code
I've always enjoyed helping people out with coding issues, I learn a lot from it and the distraction helps me with code issues of my own.  However there is a lot of repetition, so I decided to set up this site to share code and explain the reasons behind everything I'm doing.  You are welcome to simply copy and paste code or you can read up and learn the theory behind it.

The code here is what I would call best practice and my theory behind that is.
<p style="font-size:1.5em">Priority is given to making sure it works, this means making sure it is functional, accessible and meeting user expectations.  Consistency between email clients and pixel perfect design are also important but always secondary.</p>

Please also consider that this is a personal site and I'm dyslexic. It is probably full of spelling and grammar errors, don't discount the content because of this, just politely let me know and I can fix it.

With all that in mind, look at these cool things I've written.

## Email code

* [template](email-code/template.html)
* [preaheader](email-code/preheader.html)
* [link button](email-code/link-button.html)
{% include email-code.md %}
