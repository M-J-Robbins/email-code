## Hi I'm Mark

My name is Mark Robbins I've been working as an email developer since 2012.  After a while of writing email code I started to notice some of the rules and best practices were a bit over simplified.  I was told things like you can't use lists, and you can't use background images but with a little testing I found you can but there are just a few caveats to be aware of.  The more I looked into it, the more of these exceptions I found.
