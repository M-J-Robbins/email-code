# Stopping Gmail image popup

Sending emails with images in is very common, I'd guess that the vast majority of HTML emails have an `<img>` inside them somewhere.

When these emailed are opened in Gmail, it will often display a download arrow when hovered and open the image in a lightbox when clicked.

Personally I don't see this as a problem and in some cases is a nice feature, I tend to leave this as is.

However if you want to stop it there are a few ways around this.  
* Use a small image, Gmail only applies this to images of a certain size. - But small images will have lower resolution.
* Add a link to the image.  Gmail won't apply this to linked images. - But a link might not makes sense here.
* Use some code to hide the arrow. Some variation on `img + .a6S{display:none}`. - But this only removes the download icon, the cursor still shows as a pointer anda click still open the lightbox.

When chatting to [Jay](https://twitter.com/emailjay_) on [twitter](https://twitter.com/M_J_Robbins/status/1276554228710989825) the other day, about how they used the [faux absolute position](../email-enhancements/faux-absolute-position) technique in the [Email Weekly newsletter](http://emailweekly.co/). I realised that a simplified version of this  technique could also be used to solve this Gmail issue.

## The Code
{% highlight html %}
<div style="max-height:0;max-width:600px;">
  <div style="max-width:600px;padding-bottom:50%;opacity:0"></div>
</div>
<img src="https://placekitten.com/600/300" alt="kitten" style="max-width:100%;">
{% endhighlight %}

### `max-height:0;max-width:600px;`
Here I'm setting the `max-height` to create the [faux absolute position](../email-enhancements/faux-absolute-position) effect. And setting `max-width` to match the width of the image we're covering.

### `max-width:600px;padding-bottom:50%;opacity:0`
Inside that div I'm again setting the `max-width` to match that of the image.  instead of adding `height` I'm using `padding-bottom`.  Doing it this way means the height adjusts responsively for smaller viewports.  

To get the padding value the formula is `width / height * 100`.  And because Gmail supports `calc` you could even do this as `padding-bottom:calc(100% * 300 / 600);`.

`opacity:0` is used here to increase the `z-index` so that our overlay sits on top of the image and not behind it.


## Bug fixing
If you are having issues with this, there are a couple of quick things to try.

To make sure this is covering the image at all times, try increasing the opacity `opacity:0.5;` and adding a background colour `background:red;`. Now you should see a red overlay, exactly covering the image.

If you need the cover to be centre aligned try adding `margin:0 auto;` to the outer div.  Or for right aligned add `margin-left:auto;`

##Â Accessibility
I feel like there may be some accessibility concerns with stopping a mouse user being able to click on an image.   I'm not sure what that might be yet, but if you know of anything, please let me know.
